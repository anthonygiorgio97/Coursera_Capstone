    "Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario. With a recorded population of 2,731,571 in 2016, it is the most populous city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people (as of 2016) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario, while the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) proper had a 2016 population of 6,417,516. Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City, often called simply New York and abbreviated as NYC, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2019 population of 8,336,817 distributed over about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the U.S. state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass. With almost 20 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and approximately 23 million in its combined statistical area, it is one of the world's most populous megacities. New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing commerce, entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy.\n",

    "#### The problem\n",
    "Now let me explain the context of this Capstone project through a scenario. Suppose a friend who live on the west side of the city of Toronto in Canada, receive a job offer from a great company in New York, Manhattan borough. He has to move to New York City. He love his neighborhood in Toronto beacause of its variety of venues for food, parks, schools and entertainment places. Consequently he want to move in a similar zone in Manhattan borough. The aim of this project is to study and analyze the neighborhoods of Toronto city and New York city and group them into similar clusters. Finally I will use those information to find the most similar neighborhood of the two borough of the two cities."
